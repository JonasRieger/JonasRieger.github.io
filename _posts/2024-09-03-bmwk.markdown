Starting in September 2024, we receive funding in cooperation with colleagues from the Öko-Institut e.V. Freiburg and the Evangelische Hochschule Freiburg to run the joint project ["Social (in)justice in the energy transition - from the digital debate to the living world"](https://www.oeko.de/news/pressemeldungen/projektstart-mehr-gerechtigkeit-in-der-energiewende/). At TU Dortmund University, I will supervise the subproject "Monitoring narratives about the energy transition".

The aim of the joint project is to gain a better understanding of the lines of argumentation in the debate on the role of social (in)justice in the energy transition, while in the subproject we aim for developing a methodological analysis framework for both retrospective questions and the ongoing monitoring of narratives on the energy transition.

The project is scheduled to run for 30 months and has a total funding volume of about 570,000€, with our subproject receiving funding of about 100,000€. The funding is provided by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz, BMWK).
