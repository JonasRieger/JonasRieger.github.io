In the context of our project "Diskurs Energiewende: Social (in)justice in the energy transition - from the digital debate to the living world", we met with a number of project partners at TU Dortmund University. On January 26 and 27, we held intensive discussions. One of the topics we focused on were the existing stories/narratives associated with Germany's energy transition, which we want to examine more closely in order to identify and track potential misrepresentations in media coverage.

We plan to launch a project website in mid-2026. Its purpose is to present the debate on the energy transition in selected (social) media and to provide information on (issues with) opportunities of low-income groups for participation in the German energy transition. In addition to continuous (monthly updated) analysis via a dashboard, our team conducts retrospective analyses of various storylines (e.g., the "Heizungshammer" debate) using coding experiments and parameter-efficient few-shot learning.
