title:  "New R package for automated topic labeling released: topiclabels"

Together with my colleagues Fritz Peters, Andreas Fischer, Tim Lauer, and Andr√© Bittermann, I released a new R package, named topiclabels, for automated topic labeling using language models.

topiclabels leverages (large) language models for automatic topic labeling. The main function converts a list of top terms into a label for each topic. Hence, it is complementary to any topic modeling package that produces a list of top terms for each topic. While human judgement is indispensable for topic validation (i.e., inspecting top terms and most representative documents), automatic topic labeling can be a valuable tool for researchers in various scenarios.

Please visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PetersFritz/topiclabels) for a very intuitive and short introduction of the practical and flexible usage of our package.
