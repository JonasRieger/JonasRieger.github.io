In the period from November 24 to November 30, Carsten Stahl and I traveled to the Catholic University of the North (UCN, Antofagasta, Chile) to exchange ideas with research colleagues there. We are grateful for the invitation from Sebastián Herrera (Universidad de O'Higgins, Rancagua) and the fruitful exchange on his project and the projects of Brian Keith (UCN), Marcelo Lufin (UCN), Fernando Campos (Universidad de Chile, Santiago), and Carolina Rojas (Dean of the Faculty of Engineering and Geological Sciences, UCN). On the last day before departure, after having enjoyed rich scientific exchanges over the previous days, we had the opportunity to visit several industrial facilities in the wider area of Antofagasta, i.e. Puerto Coloso, La Negra, Mantos Blancos, Baquedano, Coya Sur, María Elena, Tocopilla, and Mejillones. Those impressive images will help us in our further joint research on the identification, extraction, and analysis of narratives regarding the energy transition in Chile.
